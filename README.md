# Basic-keylogger
Keyloggers are a type of monitoring software designed to record keystrokes made by a user. One of the oldest forms of cyber threat, these keystroke loggers record the information you type into a website or application and send to back to a third party.
Keyloggers collect information and send it back to a third party â€“ whether that is a criminal, law enforcement or IT department.
Use this at your own risk.
